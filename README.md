# A Basic Circuit Project of Password Management System (Digital Logic Design)

This repository contains a digital logic design project focused on implementing a basic circuit for a password management system. The project utilizes fundamental logic gates and concepts to demonstrate password authentication and visual feedback.

## Overview

The project aims to design and simulate a circuit capable of verifying a password through digital logic. Using LEDs for visual indicators, the circuit shows whether the password entered matches the predefined value. This project is built using the following components:

### Components Used:
- **IC 7486**: Quad 2-Input Exclusive-OR Gates  
- **IC 7408**: Quad 2-Input AND Gates  
- **IC 7404**: Hex Inverter (NOT Gate)  
- **Red LED**: To indicate incorrect password  
- **Green LED**: To indicate correct password

### Circuit Features:
1. **Password Input Verification**: The circuit takes binary inputs representing the password and verifies them.
2. **Output Indicators**:
   - **Red LED** lights up for incorrect input.
   - **Green LED** lights up for correct input.
3. **Logical Operations**: Implemented using XOR, AND, and NOT gates to simulate password comparison.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To replicate this project, you will need:
1. Breadboard
2. IC 7486, IC 7408, IC 7404
3. LEDs (Red and Green)
4. Resistors (for current limitation)
5. Power supply (5V DC)
6. Jumper wires

### Steps to Build:
1. **Set Up Components**: Connect the ICs and LEDs to the breadboard as per the circuit diagram.
2. **Input Switches**: Use binary inputs (e.g., toggle switches or push buttons) to represent the password.
3. **Connect Power Supply**: Provide 5V DC to power the circuit.
4. **Verify Outputs**: Test the circuit by entering various password combinations and observing the LEDs.
